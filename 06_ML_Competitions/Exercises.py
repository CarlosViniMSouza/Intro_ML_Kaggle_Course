# This notebook is an exercise in the Introduction to Machine Learning course. 
# You can reference the tutorial at this link.

# Introduction
# In this exercise, you will create and submit predictions for a Kaggle competition.
#  You can then improve your model (e.g. by adding features) to improve and see 
# how you stack up to others taking this course.

# The steps in this notebook are:

# Build a Random Forest model with all of your data (X and y).
# Read in the "test" data, which doesn't include values for the target.
# Predict home values in the test data with your Random Forest model.
# Submit those predictions to the competition and see your score.
# Optionally, come back to see if you can improve your model by adding features or 
# changing your model. Then you can resubmit to see how that stacks up on the 
# competition leaderboard.

# Recap
# Here's the code you've written so far. Start by running it again.

# Code you have previously used to load data (Congratulations for your progress ;))
